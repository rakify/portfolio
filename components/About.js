        Last 3 years I have spent most of my time learning Algorithms, Data
        Structure and doing competitive programming and for a year I have spent
        my time learning JavaScript Framework and Library. Now I want to use my
        whole skill to do something real. Thatâ€™s why I am seeking a Job that
        will allow me to gain experience and measure my performance. I believe I
        am a fast learner.
